                <p class="FollowParagraph">Epic Games released a project called broadcast package nicknamed the "Hype Chamber" which is what it is called from it being used on broadcasts. Collegiate Rocket League (CRL) is the official College league for Rocket League and they wanted to use their own version of this project on their broadcasts. I modified the exsisting project changing the looks as well as adding additional features needed for CRL.</p>

                <h2>What I did</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="Center">
                <p class="FollowParagraph"> The big visable changes can moslty be seen in this image shown on the right. One being the background on the screens being a different look to try and help blend it with the rest of the stream's elements. Another big change was removing the use of Logos and adding text into the animation to still know the teams playing.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="Center">
                <p class="FollowParagraph">There are more animations and smaller visual differences that have been changed but a large majority of what has been done doesn't get seen. This includes many automation and controls to allow many renders to be setup and completed as swiftly as possible.</p>
            </div>
			<div class="Center">
                <p class="FollowParagraph">Changes that were done included adding functionality to support switching 6 different color ways for each of the teams, and lots of additional automation to the scene updating for elements such as text, lights, textures, and materials to remove the need for the user to manually make those changes</p>

                <h2>Where and how it was used</h2>
            </div>
			<div class="Center">
				<img class="ProjectImage"  src="../../imgs/RLTwitchCRL.png" alt="Unreal Engine efuse virtual studio drexel unviversty theme">
                <p class="FollowParagraph"> As mentioned before the idea was for this to be used on for CRL productions. 5 different renders would be created for each game adding up to 25 for each of the Weekly broadcast streams, which there were 2 of a week. The first in the week being on the College Carball twitch and the second being streamed on the official Rocket League twitch channel also being the home for RLCS broadcasts.</p>
