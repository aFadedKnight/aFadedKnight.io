                <p class="FollowParagraph">The main objectives of the class involved being able to model, rig, and animate a fully finctional robot. These steps were all done in Maya as well as all of the modeling of other props or environment pieces. For rendering, we were allowed to use any tool available to us. I knew in the end I wanted to have the project rendered in Unreal Engine 5. This meant I needed to bring all of the models into Unreal as well as bring all of the animations done in Maya. Luckily this wasn't too challenging just took a few extra steps. After finishing all the work, bringing it into Unreal, and one corrupted Unreal file later, I finished off the render by adding some music.</p>
