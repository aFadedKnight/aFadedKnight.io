I disliked using any kind of template website platform as I felt like I was spending a whole lot of money and time just to not quite be able to get the look I really wanted. This lead me to coding my own website.</p>

I want to be able to showcase those projects and tell a little bit about each one just like this one here. This website is definitely something I am very proud of and have learned so much from working on it.</p>

I know I still have much more to learn but i am happy where I am at right now.</p>
