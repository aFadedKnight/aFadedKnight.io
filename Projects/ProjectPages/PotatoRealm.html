I did a little bit of cleaning up on the track to make sure it was good then exported some placeholder geamoetry and the camera separtately into one unreal project where I did the final rendering for the composite.</p>

                <p class="FollowParagraph">The final clean composite of combining the renders from unreal with the plates recorded was all done using Nuke. I reandered many different passes to get subtle detail like reflections and get just the right final look for the shot for everything to match.</p>
