    <h1>ATEM Model (7/24/23)</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="Center">
                <p class="FollowParagraph">I was able to complete my goal of having a model of an ATEM Mini textured and imported into unreal. Inside unreal I already started setting up some materials that I will be able to switch around based on the state that the button is in. I refereced an image and just applied the different materials to different buttons and got a screenshot in unreal to show what it might look like in action</p>
            </div>
			
			<div class="Center"><img class="ProjectImage"  src="../../imgs/ATEMModel.png" alt=""></div>
			<div class="Center">
				<p class="FollowParagraph">After bringing the model into unreal I already started to think about how I am going to be able to update the buttons to have the correct material. My thinking right now is that I will have in the blueprint(which my model is in) basically a class for the buttons that match each state the buttons are in.</p>
            </div>
			<div class="Center">
				<p class="FollowParagraph">Some buttons have different properties in how they are lit. Some of the buttons are only white or red and off or there are some that can be red or green and off. To keep things the most simple I am going to set up 4 different states, one for each color. It will be Active Green, Active Red, Active White, and Inactive. All buttons will probably have this but I would just not use all of them for certain buttons.</p>
            </div>
			<div class="Center">
				<p class="FollowParagraph">I am still not exactly sure what I am going to do exactly blueprint wise and what it will look like. I would like to be able to access the state of each button on the device but I am not sure if I will be able to do that with the tools that I am currently using. My plan after doing all of my testing is that I am going to use OSC to have unreal communicate with Companion which has the ability to use the ATEM API but not sure if it is set up to grab the state of everything and if I would be able to send that data to unreal.</p>
            </div>
			<div class="Center">
				<p class="FollowParagraph">With all of this I definitely think my next step will involve a lot of testing and messing around with compainion to see what I can get done using that. There is already some things i haven't thought about, like how many buttons there are, and i think I wil run into some things maybe I wasn't really expecting. I am hoping since now I have a model I can get this figured out before  Aug. 4 When I go to LA for siggraph.</p>
            </div>
			<div class="Center">
				<p class="FollowParagraph">I also am adding a new stretch goal for myself to add another model. There are 3 versions of the ATEM Mini, 2 of which look the same and the 3rd is just a bigger version of those and it shouldn't take too long to make the bigger version. It would be very helpful to allow the ability to switch which model is being displayed since it might not always be the same switchers. If it was in the scope for this 10 week project to do every ATEM switcher includeing the large switchers I would but if this is something I persue and want to do that I would want to know how I would make that happen.</p>
