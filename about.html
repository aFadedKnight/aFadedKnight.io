            <p >Currently a student at Drexel University majoring in Animation and Visual FX for my BS and Digital Media for MS. I am a 5 year student expected to graduate in the summer of 2025.</p>
            <p >What really got me into a lot of the projects I worked on was my dad. He was in the movie industry doing VFX and seeing that so much really inspired me to major in Anim/VFX. I have also really enjoyed video games my whole life and started getting driven towards Esports which led to my interest in broadcast and live production. I have been wanting to work in live production for a bit now and have even gotten the opportunity to create virtual production experiences for live esports broadcasts. The next steps in my career would be getting to work in person in a studio(greenscreen or LED wall) and work in capturing many effects live to be broadcasted or to be edited into a video.</p>
            <p >Currently on my last co op at Drexel with EwingCole on the digital media team. I also have experience in broadcasts coordinating virtual production there as well as working with Drexel's VCAP team. My main goal after graduating college will be getting to work somewhere in Unreal Engine. I love learning all kinds of things inside the engine and would love to use it in any industry as I know it has uses everywhere.</p>
