                <h1 class="About-School">Currently a student at Drexel University majoring in Animation and Visual FX. I am a 5 year student expected to graduate in 2025.</h1>
                <h1 class="About-Details-1">What really got me into a lot of the projects I worked on was my dad. He was in the movie industry doing VFX and seeing that so much really inspired me to major in anim/VFX. I have also really enjoyed video games my whole life and started getting driven towards Esports</h1>
                <h1 class="About-Details-2">Esports is something I have really been into for a while and with my skills and interests currently virtual production for broadcasts has been a big thing for me. I currently volunteer with an Esports org (Escape Velocity) where I code a discord bot as well as be apart of the graphics team. I also work at eFuse as Collegiate Coordinator - Virtual Production</h1>
